# Stammer Minecraft Club

Stammer Minecraft Club is a website that wishes to encourage young people who stammer to connect with members of the stammering community through gaming. 

The site will be targeted at young people who stammer who feel isolated or are experiencing social stigma about stammering. The site is also aimed at their parents/guardians who may be researching the club for their child/teenager. 

The website will cover information about the club ethos which promotes authenticity and a 'free-to-stammer' philosophy. The site will provide details of the club groups which are organised by age and a sign up form to register for the club. 

The site will have a high visual content with images and a video of designs created by current club members to demonstrate the wonderful creations that the club members built and portray a positive impression of creativity and fun within the club sessions.
