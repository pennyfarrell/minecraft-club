# Stammer Minecraft Club

Stammer Minecraft Club is a website that wishes to encourage young people who stammer to connect with members of the stammering community through gaming. 

The site will be targeted at young people who stammer who feel isolated or are experiencing social stigma about stammering. The site is also aimed at their parents/guardians who may be researching the club for their child/teenager. 

The website will cover information about the club ethos which promotes authenticity and a 'free-to-stammer' philosophy. The site will provide details of the club groups which are organised by age and a sign up form to register for the club. 

The site will have a high visual content with images and a video of designs created by current club members to demonstrate the wonderful creations that the club members built and portray a positive impression of creativity and fun within the club sessions.

# User Experience

## Wireframes

![Mobile wireframe page 1 - top]assets/readme-images/wireframe-mobile-top.PNG

![Mobile wireframe page 1 - top]assets/readme-images/wireframe-mobile-bottom.PNG

The wireframes were created on paper to sketch out ideas and then narrowed down to a first design in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). 

Originally, I designed desktop first but after advice from my tutor, I changed to coding mobile-first. I then created a new wireframe for mobiles. This approach later led to simpler media queries. 

On the home page, I added the timetable with the age groups so that it was very clear who the target audience is. I added an FAQ page to my second page with questions and answers directed at parents/guardians as well as young people. 

I left out the gallery because I decide to incoroproate the images throughout the website to give it a sense of fun, appeal to the young people and immerse the user in a Minecraft-like environment. 

Lastly, I added an extra Thank you page where a user is taken after filling in the form to create a more pleasant user experience.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The chosen fonts were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). "Barlow", weight Regular 400 and Medium 500 is used for the headings. "Fira Sans Extra Condensed", weight 400, is used for the quotations. Both fonts are fun and playful yet easily legible.

 * ### Color Scheme
      The chosen color scheme reflects the colors used in Minecraft Bedrock and are the colours most often used for earth blocks. The light font  was selected for contrast against the dark green and dark brown. The colours were picked from Minecraft images using Canva. The shades and contrasts were compared and selected for optimum contrast using [WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)](https://wave.webaim.org/).
