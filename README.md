# Stammer Minecraft Club

Stammer Minecraft Club is a website that wishes to encourage young people who stammer to connect with members of the stammering community through gaming. 

The site will be targeted at young people who stammer who feel isolated or are experiencing social stigma about stammering. The site is also aimed at their parents/guardians who may be researching the club for their child/teenager. 

The website will cover information about the club ethos which promotes authenticity and a 'free-to-stammer' philosophy. The site will provide details of the club groups which are organised by age and a sign up form to register for the club. 

The site will have a high visual content with images and a video of designs created by current club members to demonstrate the wonderful creations that the club members built and portray a positive impression of creativity and fun within the club sessions.

# User Experience

## Wireframes

![Mobile wireframe page 1 - top]assets/readme-images/wireframe-mobile-top.PNG

![Mobile wireframe page 1 - top]assets/readme-images/wireframe-mobile-bottom.PNG

The wireframes were created on paper to sketch out ideas and then narrowed down to a first design in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). 

Originally, I designed desktop first but after advice from my tutor, I changed to coding mobile-first. I then created a new wireframe for mobiles. This approach later led to simpler media queries. 

I originally had the timetable on page two with a gallery but I moved the timetable with the age groups to the home page so that it was very clear who the target audience for the club is. As there is a lot of content on the home page, I added a 'back-to-top' button to make it easier for the user to navigate back to the nav bar. 

I added an FAQ page to my second page with questions and answers directed at both parents/guardians as well as young people, to reflect the different needs of each user type.

I left out the gallery because I decide to incorporate the images throughout the website to weave the visuals across the whole site instead of grouping them in one place.The intention was to give the whole site a sense of fun to appeal to young people, and to immerse the user in a Minecraft-like environment throughout the site.

## Site Structure

Stammer Minecraft Club has three pages. All pages can be easily accessed through the navigation menu in the header section. The [Landing page](index.html), the [FAQ](faq.html) page and finally the [Sign Up](signup.html) page.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The chosen fonts were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). "Barlow", weight Regular 400 and Medium 500 is used for the headings. "Fira Sans Extra Condensed", weight 400, is used for the quotations. Both fonts are fun and playful yet easily legible.

 * ### Color Scheme
      The chosen color scheme reflects the colors used in Minecraft Bedrock and are the colours most often used for earth blocks. The light font was selected for contrast against the dark green and dark brown. The colours were picked from Minecraft images using Canva. The shades and contrasts were compared and selected for optimum contrast using [WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind)](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

# Features

Stammer Minecraft Club is meant to be fun, playful and welcoming with appeal to both young people and their parents/guardians. The Navigation bar makes finding the necessary information simple and the layout is responsive. All hypertext links open in a new page. The sign up form invites the parents/guardians to sign up to the relevant group. 

## Home Page

The Home Page has information and testimonials which illustrate the experience of club members to give first-hand descriptions of the real experience of being a club member. There are images showing the creations built in Minecraft during club sessions. There is a video narrated by a club member who stammers which aims to reassure potential new members that it really is ok to stammer in the club and to hear the voice of a real member. There is a description of the club groups which shows the age range that can attend and the schedule of sessions. The images are positioned to slightly reveal the next image and entice the user to scroll down the entire page.

![Home Page - section 3](assets/readme-images/home-page-section-three.PNG)

![Home Page - section 4](assets/readme-images/home-page-section-four.PNG)

### Navigation Menu

![Navigation Menu](assets/readme-images/nav-bar.PNG)

* Navigation Bar is present on all three pages to make navigation of the website easy and quick. It contains links to Home, FAQ and Sign Up pages. Its design is consistent and identical on all of the pages. This feature enables the users to navigate from page to page without having to use the "back" button of the browser.

* The main logo is also clickable and takes the user back to the home page.

### Hero Image

![Hero Image](assets/images/hero-image-mushroom-village.webp)

### Reasons Section

![Testimonials Speech Bubble One](assets/readme-images/testimonial-speech-bubble-one.PNG)

![Testimonials Speech Bubble One](assets/readme-images/testimonial-speech-bubble-two.PNG)

![Testimonials Speech Bubble One](assets/readme-images/testimonial-speech-bubble-three.PNG)

This section introduces three reasons for joining the club represented by testimonials from existing members (peers of potential club members). The aim is to get new members interested in joining the club and to convey the value of gaming with other young people who stammer by their peers. The quotes help make the information relevant and relatable to young people visiting the website and demonstrates the value of the club to prospective parents/guardians.

### Video

![Video](assets/video/club-tour.mp4)

There is a video embedded on the home page with showing some of the Minecraft creations built by club members and narrated by a young person who stammers. This would encourage potential members to have an understanding of what to expect about the club and to feel reassured that stammering is ok (and welcomed!) in the club.

### Club Timetable Section

![Club Timetable](assets/readme-images/Club-Timetable.PNG)

The purpose of this section is to succinctly show the age groups and times for each club session. The timetable is responsive on different device sizes to maximize visibility and help potential members easily access the structure of the groups (organised by age) and then identify the relevant time for that session. 

[Back to top](#contents)

### FAQ Section

![FAQ Section](assets/readme-images/FAQ-section.PNG)

The main purpose of this section is to answer questions that either parents/guardians may have as well as young people themselves.
An accordion style question-and-answer format was used to make the page look less busy, especially on smaller screens. The Font-awesome icons were used to differentiate the adult-young people sections. Colour contrasts were used to differentiate questions from answers.

### Footer

![The Footer](assets/readme-images/Footer-section.PNG)

The Footer section is consistent in design on all pages. It includes a clickable envelope icon which opens an email form on a blank page to make it easy to get connected by email. The Phone icon is clickable to easily connect a call to the club contact person. There are also links to social media pages including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. All the social media links open in a new tab. There is a 'back to top' button so that site users can easily navigate back to the top menu and nav bar.

### Sign Up Page

![Sign Up Form](assets/readme-images/Signup-form-section.PNG)

A sign up form is available for those who would like to express an interest in joining the club. There are options to select the relevant group so that the appropriate information is provided to the new member. There is a repeated timetable below the form so that site users can access the information again without having to navigate away from the page. All elements, such as parent/guardian name, young person's name, email address etc. are required.

## Thank You Page

### Thank You Message

![Thank you message](readme-images/thank_you.png)

A thank you message is displayed after filling in the contact form and the survey. The usual navigation links are available for the user to be able to return to the page of interest.

### Future Features 

* I would add an additional page with a gallery to showcase more images of the creations made by the group. 
* I would add an information section about the organisation and club leaders. However, as this is a not a real organisation, I decided to focus on other features for the purposes of the assignment.

# Credits

## Content

* The overall inspiration came from my local [Tennis Club](https://shankilltennisclub.com/) which is extremely welcoming and accomodating of new players. Visiting this club significantly helped our family with making friends, having fun, keeping fit and assimilating in the new country.
* The inspiration for the navigation and the form came from *Love Running Project*.
* The styling of "Find Your Group" section was inspired by [Czechitas](https://czechitas.cz).
* The fonts were downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* The location of the local tennis club is taken from [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).
* The "Find Your Group" page content was partly taken from this [site](https://shankilltennisclub.com/).
* The color pallete was downloaded from [coolors](https://coolors.co).
* The icons were found at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) was used to create the wireframes.
* The framework for the readme file was taken from [Wawas Wood](https://github.com/EwanColquhoun/wawaswoods/blob/master/README.md) and from [Scoops](https://github.com/amylour/scoops_pp1/blob/main/README.md#testing).

## Media

## Acknowledgements
* Extra help and guidance was received from my mentor Precious Ijege, from tutors and fellow colleagues from the Code Institute. Many an insight was received from my friend Aoife. 
* I received help from tutors with my images which were blurry (object fit: cover property and the use of grid helped), with navigation bar which was "jumping" and becoming bigger when hovered on and with my footer overflowing due to a set size of one of the elements (more details in the [Testing File](TESTING.md))
* To make the buttons on Home and Find Your Group page clickable, I used the [solution #1](https://testbook.com/web-development/how-to-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link) from the indicated website (onclick="window.location.href = 'group.html';").
* A tutorial for creating a sticky header and footer was found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_menu.asp) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSIB9zPYu4w).
* [Kevin Powell's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU) were instrumental in the use of flexbox.

Thank you all for your support and encouragement.
