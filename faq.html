        <details>
            <summary>What will we do in the game session?</summary>
            <div>We play Minecraft Bedrock in Realms. We play in creative-peaceful mode to build new creations and
                expand our private world. While we play Minecraft, we will use Zoom for the voice chat. You can join in
                with the chat as much or as little as you like. If you are a pro Minecrafter that's awesome and you'll
                be able to show off your skills. If this is a new game for you, we'd love to show you how creative mode
                works and teach you some cool new building skills!</div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>I'm not sure about meeting new people and talking to them. Do I have to talk in the session?
            </summary>
            <div><em>No, </em> the Minecraft Stammer Club is a social activity for young people who stammer to <em>speak
                    freely, stammer freely</em> and make new friends in the stammering community. We think it's really
                helpful for young people to hear other people stammer, so it can be really good to listen in to the chat
                until you get to know your new friends. We want you to have fun and feel comfortable! We think it is ok
                to stammer so you can talk to us freely, whatever way the words travel out</div>

        <details>
            <summary>I am not pro, can I still join in? </summary>
            <div><em>Yes of course!</em> We have a mix of game experience in our group. If you are a noob, we'll happily
                show you the ropes and you'll soon get your imagination going and your creative groove will kick in! If
                you are a pro, please show us your building moves so we can make some fabulous team creations!</div>

        <details>
            <summary>What game settings do you play with?</summary>
            <div>We play in creative and peaceful mode with no daylight cycle. This means we can let our imagination run
                free and build amazing things in our world! It's easier to build in sunlight without worrying about
                mobs!</div>
